After that long and
particular Detail of my
self, and of my various
Adventures in so many
different and remote parts of the
Globe, as I have lately entertain’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the Public with, I little thought
any private Occurrence, in so small
a Spot as the Island of <em>Great Britain</em>,
could have rous’d my Attention, and
broke in upon that Repose, in which
I hop’d to have spent the Remains of
a declining Life. But small and inconsiderable
as it is, I consider it is
my own Country; the Thought of
which, together with that inextinguishable
Thirst after Truth and
Knowledge, in regard to my self, and
an ardent Inclination of communicating
it to others, have prevail’d
upon me once more to be expos’d in
Print, in order to express my Abhorrence
of a late diabolical Imposture:
propagated, not so much by
the Knavery of some, as by the Ignorance
and Stupidity of others. I
need not say I mean the Rabbit Affair;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>with which, for some Weeks
past, the Minds of the People of this
Island have been so seriously and so
surprizingly employ’d; so as scarce
to leave them any Leisure for
Things of a more sublime Nature,
and of vastly greater Consequence
and Importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>And tho’ I verily believe this to
be the real and only Cause, why the
Perusal of my Travels has been so
neglected of late, which, by the Decay
of the Sale, has sensibly affected
a worthy and honest Bookseller; yet
I declare to the World, that my Motives
for entering the Lists against
Mr. <em>St. André</em> (a Person to me wholly
unknown, and unheard of till I
saw his Name in the News-Papers,
upon that unfortunate Accident,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>which befel him, when he fancied
he was poyson’d) are, that little
Skill which, by my Education and
Experience, I have attain’d in Surgery
and Anatomy, and that great
Ignorance in both, which he has betray’d
upon this Occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>For tho’ that Gentleman’s Candor
is very great in shewing such
a remarkable Alertness, at confessing
that he has been impos’d upon in
this Paltry Business; and tho’ perhaps,
by that he may flatter himself,
that he shall escape all further Censure,
yet I shall be at the Pains of
Convincing the World that he is
mistaken, even in this also; and that,
had he not been most profoundly deficient
in that discerning Penetration,
with which all true Surgeons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>make Enquiries of this sort, he
might have discover’d this Imposture
at the very first Sight, and not
have drawn in so many Persons of
distinguish’d Sense and Figure, to
be gull’d and deluded by so coarse
and palpable a Fraud.</p>

<p class='c009'>For, to begin with his Narrative; a
true Surgeon, one, I mean, orderly
and properly educated in that worthy
Profession, would never have suffer’d
his Curiosity to be at all alarm’d by
seeing a Letter from <em>Guildford</em>, which
mention’d a Woman’s <em>being deliver’d
of five Rabbits</em>: Suppose one were
to see a Letter from <em>Battersea</em>, importing
that a Woman there had
been deliver’d of five Cucumbers, or
indeed a hundred Letters, would
that lead a Man of Sense to believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>any Thing, but, either that the People
who wrote those Letters had
been grossly impos’d upon themselves,
or intended to impose upon
him. Either of these two Things
may, and do happen every Day;
but it was never known, that ever
any Creature brought forth any one
Creature of a Species in all Respects
different from it self, much less five
or seventeen such Creatures; for
which therefore, a Man of common
Sense, much more a penetrating
and quicksighted Anatomist,
should look upon all such Letters
with the utmost Contempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet it was the Sight of two or
three such Letters (and those flagrant
with most conspicuous Tokens
of Imposture) which induc’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Mr. <em>St. André</em>, at this time of the
Year, to take two Journeys to
<em>Guildford</em>, in order to enquire into
the Truth of what, in Nature, it
was impossible should be true. However,
to <em>Guildford</em> he came for the
first time; where I shall attend him
a while, and watch his Motions,
perhaps to a better Purpose than he
did those of the Rabbit-bearing Woman:
For tho’, with all his Skill
he was not able to detect her Fraud,
I hope with very little of mine to
display his Ignorance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first Place, how stupid
must he have been, not to suspect
a Trick, when <em>Howard</em>, upon being
sent for, came and acquainted him,
<em>that the Woman was actually in Labour
of the fifteenth Rabbit</em>. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>puts me in Mind of what, above six
and Forty Years ago, I learn’d at
School; where the Sagacity of old
<em>Simo</em> in the <em>Andria</em> of the <em>Terence</em> appears,
to the utter Shame of our modearn
<em>St. Andrians</em>: The old Gentleman
had Reason to suspect Fraud
from the known Character of a crafty
Knave he had to deal with; and
whose Business it was to make him
believe, that a certain Lady was just
then in Labour: Accordingly, as
they approach her House, she contrives
to be in one of her Labour
Pains, and cries out so loud that the
old Man must needs hear it: upon
which, I remember, he says, with
much Humour and Judgment, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hui,
tam cito? ridiculum. Postquam ante ostium
me audivit stare, approperat. Non
sat commode divisa sunt temporibus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>tibi, Dave, hæc.</span></i> For thus, had he
been credulous enough to go to
<em>Guildford</em> to inquire into this Cheat,
he would have said, in plain <em>English</em>,
upon the like Occasion, <em>What a pox,
is she so quick? this is the damn’dest
Joke that ever was: the Moment she
hears I am arrived, she falls into one
of her Labour Pains: ah</em>, Howard!
<em>this was not well tim’d of you by
any means</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, to return from this Digression,
if the Woman was <em>actually in
Labour of the fifteenth Rabbit</em>, why
should Mr. <em>Howard</em> leave her, and
stay with Mr. <em>St. André</em> till they
call’d him again, when she was
said to be in one of her Labour
Pains? Here a wise Man would
have smelt a Rat instead of a Rabbit:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>And much more, when this
Woman in Labour Pains, and who
had been in Labour some time then,
nay fourteen times before, was <em>found
dress’d in her Stays, and sitting on the
Bed-side</em>; and that not for want of
Help to put her to Bed; for there
were <em>several Women near her</em>. A Man
must have a spritely Genius for swallowing
Imposture that was not stagger’d
at such an Appearance. This
sure it was that prompted Mr. <em>St.
André</em> to wave all such Reflections,
and proceed <em>immediately to examine
her</em>; when, tho’ by his own Confession,
he <em>did not find the Parts prepar’d
for her Labour</em>, (which was
another plain Indication of the Roguery)
yet he was weak enough to
<em>wait for the coming on of fresh Pains</em>,
and, <em>in three or four Minutes after, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>think he deliver’d her of the intire Trunk,
strip’d of its Skin, of a Rabbit about
four Months Growth</em> (he meant to
have said, of an Animal of the Size
and Figure of a Rabbit of four
Months Growth) <em>in which the Heart
and Lungs were contain’d, with the
Diaphragm intire</em>. Well, what does
my Gentleman then? He <em>instantly
cut of a piece of them, and tried them
in Water</em>; in which they swam, and
when they were <em>press’d to the Bottom,
rose again</em>. Now, it being notoriously
the Property of the Lungs
of a <em>Fœtus</em> to sink, and of a Creature
which has been some time
brought forth alive to swim, in Water;
what but an absolute Prepossession
in favour of this filthy Miracle,
or a consummate Ignorance in these
Matters could have hinder’d any sober
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Inquirer from being determin’d
in relation to this Cheat, by the
foregoing Trial? Yet Mr. <em>St. André</em>
never boggles at this, nor at the
Impossibility of the Trunk of such
a Creature’s (suppos’d but just before
to be alive) being stript of its
Skin, by the contractive Faculty of
the Womb; nor at the Woman’s
being <em>chearful and easy, and walking
by her self from the Bed-side to the
Fire the Moment she was deliver’d</em>:
But goes on <em>conjecturing</em> in a yet more
absurd manner, that these Creatures,
(as big as Rabbits of four Months
Growth, which must be within a
Trifle as big as full grown ones,)
were bred in the <em>Fallopian Tubes</em>;
and came into the <em>Uterus</em> one after
another, where they lay and kick’d,
till they were press’d to Death, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>flead, and all their Bones broken, in
such a manner, that they were sensibly
heard to snap, by the violent
convulsive Motions of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I take the Liberty to inform my
Readers, upon this Occasion, that
the <em>Fallopian Tubes</em> are a Passage of
Communication, of scarce three Inches
long, between the <em>Ovaria</em> and
<em>Uterus</em>; thro’ which the <em>Embryo</em>,
after Conception, is convey’d from
the one to the other. And tho’ at
that End next the <em>Uterus</em> they open,
somewhat like the Mouth of
a Trumpet, yet, when stretch’d to
the utmost, the general Canal of
them scarce exceeds the Thickness
of ones Finger: And therefore the
Impossibility of any one such Creature
being contain’d there, much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>less of eighteen, as this Gentleman
suppos’d, must appear to every one
of a common Understanding. He
tells us, no Blood nor Water issued
from the <em>Vagina</em> after this Delivery,
and that her Pulse was regular.
Monstrous! that none of these Indications
should open Mr. <em>St. André</em>’s
Eyes. If he thought at all, what
could he be thinking of? It is notorious,
that in Births of dead Children,
Women suffer much more
Pain than in those of Living ones;
so as to be, during the Operation, in
high Fevers, with irregular Pulses,
and left in great Weakness afterwards.
Yet this Woman is deliver’d
of fifteen dead Rabbits, such as
of four Months Growth, without any
Alteration in her Pulse, without the
least Inflammation or Laceration in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>her <em>Vagina</em>, walking from the Bed-side,
sitting down in a Chair by
the Fire, as well as if nothing had
happen’d; and skilful Mr. <em>St. André</em>
swallowing this foul Imposture,
without the least Squeamishness or
Reluctance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the <em>Rectum</em> of this Animal,
which remain’d affix’d to the Body,
Mr. <em>St. André</em> finds <em>five or six Pellets,
much of the same Colour and Consistence
of the common Dung of a Rabbit</em>.
Strange! that this should not
alarm him! (it being notorious that
the Excrement of a <em>Fœtus</em> is always
liquid) but this he swallows likewise;
as he does <em>the Skin roll’d
and squeez’d up like a Ball</em>, which
he delivers her of some time after:
And not long after that, of <em>the
Head, with the Fur on, Part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>one of the Ears being torn off</em>. Upon
all which Occasions, I mean those of
the Womb’s having the Faculty of
skinning a Rabbit all but the Head,
of rolling this Skin up like a Ball,
and tearing off a Piece of an Ear;
this Gentleman speaks as familiarly
as if they were common Cases,
which wanted not in the least to be
accounted for, or wonder’d at.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Intervals between these notable
Deliveries, Mr. <em>St. André</em> diverted
himself and his Company, <em>by
examining the several Rabbits, which
were kept separate, in distinct Pots,
with Spirits of Wine, in the Order
that they were brought away</em>. Here
likewise, I will do my self the Honour
to attend him. And now,
methinks, I see him expatiating, in
a very genteel adroit manner, upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the general Resemblance, but particular
and significant Difference between
them and natural Rabbits.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>The first</em>,” says he, “<em>does not appear
to be a perfect Rabbit, in all its Parts</em>.”
(Here one would suppose, the Difference
lay in some one or two, at
most, minute, not easily observable,
Circumstances, in which this Creature
varied from a Rabbit: But, on
the contrary, it seems ’twas a perfect
Cat in all its Parts, one or two
only excepted.) “<em>Three of the Feet
being like the Paws of a Cat; the
Stomach and Intestines like those in
the same Animal; as also the Shape
and Figure of the</em> Thorax. Observe,
<em>the Lungs and Heart, how
entirely they are out of their natural
Situation; and squeez’d out between
the upper Ribs, and</em> Vertebræ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><em>of the Neck</em> (doubtless by the
convulsive Motion of the <em>Uterus</em>)
<em>to which Parts</em>, observe how
<em>strongly they grow and adhere. The
Lungs of this Creature, had they
been plac’d in their natural Cavity,
would not have fill’d above a sixth
Part of it. The Bones of this Creature
are likewise all so different in
Substance and Structure from those
of common Rabbits</em>, that o’ my Conscience,
<em>the Head and one Paw
only excepted</em>, I think it has not the
least Resemblance of them. <em>All
the other thirteen Animals</em> I pronounce
<em>to be in every particular, like
well-form’d, common, natural Rabbits,
from the size of two Months
Growth to four. These have been
all broken to pieces much in the
same manner; but when these several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>parts are put together in their proper
order, they manifestly make up
and appear to belong to the abovemention’d
Animals.</em> I confess <em>the</em> Viscera
<em>are wanting in four or five of
them</em>; but that is not very material;
that Defect is amply supply’d
by this <em>one remarkable Circumstance,
which is, that most of these Animals</em>
(for Rabbits I will not call them)
<em>as far as I can judge, are Females.
The Flesh of these Creatures, particularly
of that which I extracted, has
the Smell of Rabbits just kill’d; and
the Substance of their Bones are, in
all respects, like the Bones of</em> Fœtus
<em>Rabbits</em>. (How particular, how
dilucid, and exact is this part of
his Lecture!) <em>From all these Considerations</em>
(and many more too tedious
and impertinent to be recited)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>with greater Assurance than
Knowledge, <em>I am fully convinc’d,
that, at the same time that the external
Appearance of these Animals
is exactly like such Creatures as must
inevitably undergo the Changes that
happen to adult Animals, by Food
and Air, they carry within them the
strongest Marks of</em> Fœtus’<em>s, even in
such Parts as cannot exist in an Adult,
and without which a</em> Fœtus
<em>cannot possibly be suppos’d to live.
This, I think, proves in the strongest
Terms possible, that these Animals
are of a particular kind, and not bred
in a natural way; nor will there be
any Doubt remaining (even with the
least knowing in these Matters)</em>
when these things come to be
clear’d up by <em>the Anatomy of these
præternatural Rabbits</em> (a præternatural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Anatomist Thou art without
Dispute) <em>which I shall publish with
all convenient Speed, with their Figures
taken from the Life, and compar’d
with the Parts of Rabbits of
the same Growth</em> (he would have
said <em>the same size</em>) <em>that the Differences
before-mention’d may be fully
understood</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This therefore the publick has
still just Reason to insist upon from
Mr. <em>St. André</em>; for, however he may
pretend to be impos’d upon by others
in the Delivery of these Supposititious
Rabbits, the learned anatomical
Observations, recited above,
are purely the Result of his own
Skill and Judgment; and cannot
with any Colour of Reason, be
plac’d to the Account of Fraud and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Imposture in others. Especially <em>those
Facts</em> which he has the Assurance to
say <em>were verified, before his Majesty on</em>
Saturday, Nov. <em>the 26th, by the anatomical
Demonstration of the first, the
third, fifth and ninth of these Animals</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, not content with having
sufficiently plac’d his Reputation
at stake in this audacious manner
(for such I must call it) on the
wretched Observations abovemention’d,
<em>out he sets for</em> Guildford <em>again,
being resolv’d to bring the Woman to
Town if there was any Prospect of more
Rabbits</em>. What could this Creature,
this Animal have in his Head
to hinder him from concluding
that a Woman in such a Condition
(were it possible any Woman
could be in such a Condition)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>should not be mov’d out of her Bed;
much less out of her House, and
much less from <em>Guildford</em> to <em>London</em>.
Yet since he is resolv’d upon
another Expedition, I am resolv’d
once more to attend him thither,
and observe his Motions.</p>

<p class='c009'>And here he is again so keen upon
this vile false Scent, that tho’ he
finds Mr. <em>Howard</em> standing at his
Door, who tells him that he hop’d
all was over, because that he did
not perceive in the <em>Uterus</em> any Motion
as usual, yet he visited her several
Times that Day, proceeded in
every Respect, with the same Sagacity
as before; and towards eight
a Clock that Evening, deliver’d her
of a Piece of one of the Membranes
of a <em>Placenta</em> (admirable!) roll’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>up like Parchment. This shews how
well he is acquainted with the Texture
of those Membranes. And his
Deficiency in that Point was further
confirm’d by a second Delivery of
(what he took to be) <em>another Piece
of Membrane, in Structure, Shape and
Size, exactly like the former</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus I have touch’d upon, and
I hope abundantly expos’d the profound
Observations contain’d in Mr.
<em>St. André</em>’s short <em>Narrative</em>. Whenever
he appears in Print again, upon
this Occasion, as I find he threatens
to do, I shall again be ready to
guard the Public against being deluded
by his pretended Discoveries.
And, tho’ it is not my Nature to
insult any Man upon Account of his
Misfortunes, whether brought upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>him by his own Folly, or the
Malice of others; yet give me
Leave to say, it is, of the two, a
much more eligible Evil, that the
Presumption of one ignorant Empiric,
should undergo a public Chastisement,
than the Understandings, of
so many of his Majesty’s Loyal Subjects,
be corrupted by such sham Demonstrations.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, after all, as I am a no less
strict Lover of Justice, than an indefatigable
Searcher after Truth;
now my Resentment of Mr. <em>St. André</em>’s
ill Conduct in this Affair, is
somewhat cool’d by the Liberty I
have taken in censuring and exposing
it, I shall offer something, by
Way of Abatement of that severe
Construction, the World will be apt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to pass upon his Judgment in this
Affair.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the <em>first</em> Place, I have the Charity
to believe he has been egregiously
impos’d upon, in Relation
to the Character he has publish’d
of Mr. <em>Howard</em>, whom he stiles, <em>a
Man of known Probity</em>; whereas that
Name is as notorious at <em>Guildford</em>,
and the Parts adjacent, for denoting
a Whisker, as ever mine was at
<em>Redriff</em>, for establishing a Truth.
<em>Secondly</em>, it must be consider’d that
the Pleasure of being talk’d of, and
heard to talk, in all Companies
public and private, as the very second
Discoverer (Mr. <em>Howard</em> being
indisputably the first) of this extraordinary
and præternatural Production,
must needs swell the Mind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>a raw Practitioner with Vanity, and
make him run blindfold into a Series
of Absurdities; no one of which,
at another Time, would have found
any Admittance within the Bar of
his Judgment. And <em>Thirdly</em>, The
Nature of Climates, together with
the several Makes, Capacities and
Tempers of the Inhabitants of different
Countries, are the Reason why
Things may appear puzzling and
perplexing in one Place, which in another
would be accounted for, with
the greatest Ease and Certainty
imaginable; and why that, which
is here a Cause of the highest Ridicule,
in a contrary Part of the
Globe, would be the Occasion of
raising a Man’s Character to the
most exalted Pitch of Dignity and
Reputation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>For Example, had a Native of
the Kingdom of <em>Lilliput</em>, happen’d
to be in this our Island, when the
Story of the Rabbits was first vented
at Court; and had such a one
been dispatch’d to <em>Guildford</em>, in Order
to enquire into the Truth of
that Matter; upon the first View of
those Pellets, against which Mr. <em>St.
André</em> had no Objection, he, with
his fine Microscopic Eyes, would
have instantly discover’d every particular
Herb the Creature had
fed on that Meal. And what
Mr. <em>St. André</em> calls <em>a dirty-colour’d</em>
Mucus, <em>such as is constantly
found in the Bowels of all</em>
Fœtus <em>Animals, and such as in those
that void their Excrements in Pellets,
is commonly hard and dry</em>, our <em>Lilliputian</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>would have distinguish’d to
have been nothing but a Parcel of
mere Rabbit’s Dung, which to him
would have appear’d as coarse
and large as a Scavenger’s Load,
fresh taken from a Butcher’s Lay-stall
would do to us. And that which,
<em>in the middle of the Gut</em> Ilium <em>of the
Cat</em>, Mr. <em>St. André</em> thought was <em>like a
very small Fish Bones</em>, the more quicksighted
little Man would have demonstrated
to have been nothing
more than the Bones of a Herring,
which that Creature had devoured
a few Hours before it was thrust into
the <em>Vagina</em> of <em>Mary Toft</em>’s <em>Uterus</em>.
Tho’, as Arts are very much improv’d
with us, I question whether
a very ordinary magnifying Glass,
such as Children use to divert themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>with, might not have made
the Discovery as well.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, if I am rightly inform’d, as
to the Nature of Mr. <em>St. André</em>’s
Education, I am strangely surpriz’d
that He, of all People, should appear
so unacquainted with the Materials
of which the Strings of a Fiddle are
compos’d.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again, tho’, in any of the <em>European</em>
Nations, those that pretend to any
Skill in Anatomy or Midwifery
would be scouted to Eternity for only
questioning, or going to make Inquiry,
whether it was possible for a
Woman to be delivered of eighteen
Rabbits, from two to four Months
Growth; or a <em>Fœtus</em> of that Size,
but just dead, and whose <em>Flesh smelt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>like that of a Rabbit newly kill’d</em>,
should be voided in Fragments and
Bits; or that the same Woman, notwithstanding
all these Deliveries,
should be, during the whole time,
perfectly healthy and well, feeding
on nothing but Beef, Red-herring,
&amp;c. or that a Piece of Hog’s Bladder
could be part of the <em>Chorion</em>, or
Membrane of the <em>Placenta</em>; yet give
me leave to say, that in the Kingdom
of <em>Balnibarbi</em>, these things
would appear in quite another Light.
There, tho’ a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virtuoso</span></i> should only
endeavour at a Demonstration of
this kind, spend many Years in the
Attempt, and all his Labours prove
abortive at last, yet would his Suppositions
be sure to meet with so kind
a Reception from the publick, as to
procure, at least, his being adopted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemine contradicente</span></i>, into the Academy
of Sciences there; (of which I
profess my self an unworthy Member.)
Nay, it is ten to one but he
would be taken up into the floating
Island, and appointed Anatomist extraordinary
to the Court of <em>Laputa</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such is the Use I am always determin’d
to make of this my Knowledge
of the World and Mankind.
As I will not suffer any upstart Pretender,
of what Profession soever, to
monopolize and vend his Absurdities
within this my native Country,
without such Animadversions as may
serve to warn the publick against
him: So, on the other side, if he
happens to have any Merit which
would shine and be distinguish’d in
other Regions of the Earth, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>shall be ready to do Justice in that
Point also, by letting him know in
what part of the World he may be
sure to find a proper Reward.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I can’t conclude, without seriously
lamenting the great Detriment
like to accrue to our Nation
by the Stir which has been made about
this foul Imposture, both by
the Actors and Examiners of it; and
that as well in regard to the Warreners
and Poulterers, (who complain
that the Consumption of Rabbits,
within this Metropolis, is become,
by two thirds, less than it
was formerly;) as in relation to
those obscene and indecent Images,
which for more than these nine Days
last past, beyond all Example, have
fill’d the Minds, and furnish’d out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the Conversation of People of all
Ranks, Ages and Conditions. And
whether Ideas of this Nature are fit
to be put into the Heads of rude
Boys, Boarding-school Girls, and
Old Maids, I leave every discreet
and prudent Matron to judge.</p>

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
